# Background

According to the National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS), the suicide rate increased 33 percent from 1999 through 2017^[Suicide Mortality in the United States, 1999â€“2017, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm], from 10.5 to 14 suicides per 100,000 people. Suicide ranks as the fourth leading cause of death for people ages 35 to 54, and the second for 10 to 34-year-olds. Suicide is a serious social problem. We seek to understand the possible risk factors that contribute to suicide rate by analyzing the relationship between education attainment and suicide rate. Given that socioeconomic status is associated with suicide attempt, __we hypothesize that education attainment, as an important measurement of socioeconomic class, is negatively correlated with suicide rate__.

# -set default figure widths and heights for all code blocks, unless you 
#  override them

  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 16/2, fig.height = 9/2

# Conclusion & Significance

__Moderate negative correlation__ is found between education attainment and suicide rate, which means that the higher the education attainment, the lower the suicide rate. Possible explanation for this result could be that people who do not drop out of school tend to have better family background, thus they are less likely to have childhood trauma (abusive parents), and are more likely to commit suicide. The result emphasizes the importance of social determinants in suicide risk.
